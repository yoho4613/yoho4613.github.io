        1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        My long-term goal is to create innovative and engaging websites and web
        applications that meet my clients' needs and exceed their expectations.
        I want to continuously learn and stay up-to-date on the latest web
        development technologies and trends, and hone my programming skills in
        order to create high-quality, efficient, and secure products. I'm also
        interested in exploring different fields such as machine learning and
        artificial intelligence in order to create more dynamic and interactive
        web applications. In the long run, I aspire to become a technical leader
        in the web development community and help others in their journey to
        becoming successful web developers.

        2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        My strengths include a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. I am experienced with creating and building web applications
        from scratch with a clean and organized codebase. I am also familiar
        with popular front-end frameworks, such as React and Angular, as well as
        back-end technologies such as Node.js and PHP. I am comfortable with
        version control systems such as Git and am experienced with working in
        team environments. My limitations as a web developer are related to my
        lack of experience with certain technologies, such as database
        management and mobile development. I am also not as familiar with
        certain back-end technologies, such as ASP.NET or Java. Although I am
        capable of learning these technologies quickly, I need time and guidance
        to become proficient in them. Additionally, I have limited experience
        with UX/UI design and lack the creative skills to design beautiful and
        user-friendly web applications.

        3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Developing strong communication, interpersonal, and problem-solving
        skills are essential to navigating the complex environment of
        Dev-Academy. Learning how to effectively collaborate, negotiate, and
        evaluate resources will help you become a successful and sought-after
        team member. Building your understanding of the human element of
        software engineering is also important; being able to effectively manage
        and work with people from all backgrounds, discuss ideas, and
        communicate decisions requires both technical and non-technical skills.
        Developing a basic understanding of psychology and principles of project
        management can help you better understand the dynamics of software
        engineering teams and the roles of different members. Finally,
        cultivating a growth mindset and learning how to think critically and
        analytically will help you gain new perspectives and help you develop
        better solutions.

        o An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
        and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
        representatives <br />
        o What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
        you
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Managing workload in this program requires a combination of time
        management, self-motivation and discipline. In order to stay productive
        and safe, it is important to create a schedule, prioritize tasks, and
        take regular breaks. If the workload becomes too much, it is important
        to take time out to relax and focus on one's mental and physical health.
        Meditation, yoga and other relaxation methods can be beneficial for both
        mental and physical well-being. Additionally, seeking help from mentors
        or peers may also help to lighten the workload and further improve
        productivity.

        5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I make a commitment to seek help in a timely way, using the best
        resources available. I will stay up to date on the latest industry
        trends and technologies, and be willing to ask questions when I don't
        know something. I will not hesitate to reach out to colleagues, mentors,
        and other professionals for assistance. Additionally, I will attend
        trade shows, conferences, and other events to stay informed and
        connected. I will also take advantage of online resources such as
        tutorials, forums, and other educational materials to further my
        knowledge and skills.

        6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The Facilitation team at a company should provide a range of services to
        help ensure smooth operations. This includes helping to facilitate
        meetings, create educational materials, and provide support to the team
        to ensure their goals are met. They should be organized and have
        excellent communication skills to ensure that everyone involved is on
        the same page. Additionally, Facilitators should be able to take
        constructive feedback and provide feedback to team members in a
        professional manner. They should be knowledgeable about the company and
        its products, so they can help provide direction to the team and help
        troubleshoot any issues that may arise. Finally, Facilitators should be
        able to anticipate upcoming needs and provide solutions to problems
        quickly and efficiently.

        7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Scheduling is an important aspect of successful time management and
        should be taken seriously. It's best to create a schedule in advance to
        ensure that you do not book yourself for more than you can handle.
        Establishing a routine and planning your commitments in advance can also
        help you stay organized and ensure that your daily tasks are handled
        efficiently. Important commitments such as family time, school
        drop-offs, or any other time-sensitive activities should be scheduled in
        advance to ensure that you have time to attend to them. It is also
        important to block out any time that is devoted to leisure or
        relaxation, so that you can stay energized and productive.

      <h2 class="blog__h2">Well-being / Oranga Plan</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Prioritize sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to ensure you are
        well-rested and able to focus on your work. Take breaks: It's important
        to take regular breaks throughout the day to avoid burnout and maintain
        your energy levels. Take a 5-10 minute break every hour to stretch, walk
        around, or simply rest your eyes. Stay active: Incorporate physical
        activity into your daily routine, whether it's going for a run,
        practicing yoga, or simply taking a walk outside. This can help reduce
        stress and improve your mood. Connect with others: Working in isolation
        can be challenging, so make sure to connect with others regularly.
        Schedule regular video calls with friends or colleagues, or join online
        communities related to your interests. Set boundaries: It's important to
        set boundaries between work and personal time to prevent burnout.
        Establish a consistent work schedule and avoid checking work emails or
        messages outside of those hours. Practice mindfulness: Incorporate
        mindfulness practices into your routine, such as meditation or deep
        breathing exercises, to help reduce stress and improve your focus. Learn
        new skills: Continuous learning and personal development can help keep
        you engaged and motivated in your work. Set aside time each week to
        learn a new skill or explore a new technology.
